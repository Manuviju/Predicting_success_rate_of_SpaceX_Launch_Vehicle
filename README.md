# Predicting_success_rate_of_SpaceX_Launch_Vehicle

**Understanding the Business problem:-**

We will trying to determine the cost of each launch through finding the success rate of launch vehicle.

Therefore if we can determine 'if the first stage will land', we can determine the cost of a launch.

**Use of Data science and methodology**

It includes collecting data and analyzing it with various methods, visualization and prediction.

We will make an use of classification model for launch outcome for predicting success rate.

Finding best model for the purpose, Applying various ML models and scrutinizing through evaluation to check for best accuracy
